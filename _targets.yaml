# Global configuration for the {targets} pipeline
# See: https://books.ropensci.org/targets/config.html

main:
  # Directory where {targets} stores its cache (metadata + results).
  # Using a hidden folder keeps the project root cleaner.
  store: ".targets"

  # Entry-point R script that defines the pipeline:
  # - tar_option_set()
  # - list(...) with all targets (targets_scraping, targets_import, ...)
  script: "_targets.R"

  # Progress reporter used by tar_make():
  #   "summary"   : compact status lines (good default for most projects)
  #   "balanced"  : a bit more detail, but still concise
  #   "verbose"   : one line per target, very chatty
  #   "silent"    : no progress output
  #   "timestamp" : only timestamps + high-level info
  #
  # You can change this value temporarily in R with:
  #   tar_config_set(reporter_make = "verbose")
  reporter_make: "balanced"
