# File: config/global.yml
# Global configuration for the URV SDGs tracker pipeline.
#
# This file is meant to centralise configuration for all pipeline phases:
#   - load (data access and loading)
#   - translate (optional translation layer)
#   - sdg_detection (text2sdg parameters, model choices, etc.)
#
# Many sections and fields are commented out for now. They are placeholders
# for future extensions and documentation.
